# This tag can be used to specify the character encoding of the source files

# where <filter> is the value of the INPUT_FILTER tag, and <input-file> is the

# that doxygen needs, which is dependent on the configuration options used (e.g.

# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefore more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.

# When the SEARCHENGINE tag is enabled doxygen will generate a search box for
# the HTML output. The underlying search engine uses javascript and DHTML and
# should work on any modern browser. Note that when using HTML help
# (GENERATE_HTMLHELP), Qt help (GENERATE_QHP), or docsets (GENERATE_DOCSET)
# there is already a search function so this one should typically be disabled.
# For large projects the javascript based search engine can be slow, then
# enabling SERVER_BASED_SEARCH may provide a better solution. It is possible to
# search using the keyboard; to jump to the search box use <access key> + S
# (what the <access key> is depends on the OS and browser, but it is typically
# <CTRL>, <ALT>/<option>, or both). Inside the search box use the <cursor down
# key> to jump into the search results window, the results can be navigated
# using the <cursor keys>. Press <Enter> to select an item or <escape> to cancel
# the search. The filter options can be selected when the cursor is inside the
# search box by pressing <Shift>+<cursor down>. Also here use the <cursor keys>
# to select a filter and <Enter> or <escape> to activate or cancel the filter
# option.

SEARCHENGINE           = YES

# When the SERVER_BASED_SEARCH tag is enabled the search engine will be
# implemented using a web server instead of a web client using Javascript. There
# are two flavors of web server based searching depending on the EXTERNAL_SEARCH
# setting. When disabled, doxygen will generate a PHP script for searching and
# an index file used by the script. When EXTERNAL_SEARCH is enabled the indexing
# and searching needs to be provided by external tools. See the section

SERVER_BASED_SEARCH    = NO

# When EXTERNAL_SEARCH tag is enabled doxygen will no longer generate the PHP

# external search engine pointed to by the SEARCHENGINE_URL option to obtain the
# search results.
#
# Doxygen ships with an example indexer (doxyindexer) and search engine
